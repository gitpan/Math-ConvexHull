Math::ConvexHull
================

Math::ConvexHull is a simple module that calculates convex hulls from
a set of points in 2D space. It is a straightforward implementation
of the algorithm known as Graham's scan which, with complexity of
O(n*log(n)), is the fastest known method of finding the convex hull
of an arbitrary set of points. There are some methods of eliminating
points that cannot be part of the convex hull. These may or may not
be implemented in a future version.
